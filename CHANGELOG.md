## [0.3.3] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **Mobile Drag & Drop UX Critical Fix**
  - Fixed mobile scroll being blocked when touching word cards
  - Increased TouchSensor activation delay from 150ms to 1000ms (1 second) for better scroll vs drag distinction
  - Removed `touch-none` CSS class from mobile word cards that was preventing natural scrolling
  - Disabled PointerSensor on mobile devices to prevent conflict with TouchSensor
  - Mobile users can now scroll freely by touching anywhere on the screen, including word cards
  - Drag activation requires 1 second hold + 5px movement tolerance

### Changed
- **WordTable Component**
  - Platform-specific sensor configuration: PointerSensor for desktop only, TouchSensor for mobile only
  - Removed cursor-grab classes from mobile cards (desktop-only feature)
  - Updated mobile drag instruction: "Hold any card for 1 second, then drag to new position"

### Technical Details
- **Sensor Configuration (WordTable.jsx)**
  - Desktop: PointerSensor with 8px distance activation
  - Mobile: TouchSensor with 1000ms delay + 5px tolerance
  - KeyboardSensor remains active on both platforms
  - Conditional sensor initialization based on `isMobile` state

- **CSS Changes**
  - Removed `touch-none` and `cursor-grab` classes from SortableCard component

### UX Improvements
- Mobile scrolling now works naturally on word cards
- Accidental drag operations prevented by 1 second hold requirement
- Clear separation between scroll (quick swipe) and drag (long press) gestures
- Desktop drag & drop unchanged: immediate activation with 8px movement

### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING**: Mobile drag activation delay increased from 150ms to 1000ms
  - Users must hold cards for 1 full second before dragging
  - Trade-off: Better scroll UX vs slightly slower drag activation

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-04
