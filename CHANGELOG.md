## [0.5.1] - 06/10/2025

### Fixed
- **Mobile view layout for added words**

  - Now users can edit words after adding them, allowing corrections for mistakes.

  - Conditional sensor initialization based on `isMobile` state

- **CSS Changes**
  - Removed `touch-none` and `cursor-grab` classes from SortableCard component

## [0.3.1] - 04/10/2025

### Fixed
- **Mobile & Desktop Drag & Drop UX Improvements**
  - Fixed mobile drag & drop not working properly with only small icon draggable.
